[mod-setting-description]
hide-military-tech-override-show-all=This setting completely disables the functionality of the mod. All technologies and items will be visible.\n\nUse this setting if you temporarily want to show all hidden technologies and items without removing the mod.
hide-military-tech-hide-flamethrower=Hides all technologies and items related to flamethrowers.\n\nThis includes the flamethrower turret, flamethrower gun and flamethrower ammo, as well as the "Refined flammables" upgrade technologies.\n\nBy default, flamethrowers are hidden, since they are ineffective against asteroids.
hide-military-tech-hide-laser-turret=Hides all technologies and items related to laser turrets.\n\nThis includes the "Laser" base technology, since it is only required for laser turrets (and other technologies that are always hidden).\n\nBy default, laser turrets are not hidden. While they are ineffective against larger asteroids, they can be useful against smaller asteroids in some scenarios.
hide-military-tech-hide-tank=Hides the technology and recipe for tanks.\n\nPlease note that cannon shells will always be hidden.\n\nBy default, tanks are not hidden. They can be useful vehicles and have some advantages over cars, like remote driving and damage resistance against trees.
hide-military-tech-hide-uranium-ammo=Hides the technology and recipe for uranium ammo.\n\nPlease note that this technology requires the tank technology. Setting this to visible will automatically make the tank technology visible as well.\n\nBy default, uranium ammo is hidden. While it is effective against asteroids, it depends on expensive imports from Nauvis, which makes uranium ammo unfeasible for space platforms.
hide-military-tech-hide-health-upgrades=Hides the "Health 1-âˆž" infinite technology which gives a bonus on the character's health.\n\nBy default, the Health technology is not hidden. Increasing the character's health can be helpful, for example to reduce damage by lightning on Fulgora.
hide-military-tech-hide-early-armor=Hides the recipes for "Light armor" and "Heavy armor".\n\nThese early tiers of armor don't have an equipment grid yet, they only increase your damage resistance.\n\nPlease note that the "Heavy armor" technology is always visible, since it's required for later technologies.\n\nBy default, the recipes for light/heavy armor are not hidden.
hide-military-tech-hide-submachine-gun=Hides the recipe for the submachine gun.\n\nBy default, the submachine gun is not hidden, since it can be a useful tool to manually destroy entities without mining them.
hide-military-tech-hide-shotguns=Hides the recipes for the basic shotgun, the combat shotgun and shotgun ammo.\n\nBy default, shotguns are hidden, since they aren't very useful outside of combat.
hide-military-tech-hide-cluster-grenade=Hides the recipe for the cluster grenade.\n\nBy default, the cluster grenade is hidden. They can be effective to clear large areas of trees, though.
hide-military-tech-hide-handheld-railgun=Hides the recipe for the handheld railgun.\n\nThis only affects the handheld version of the railgun. The railgun turrets and railgun ammo will always be visible, since they are essential for late-game space travel.\n\nBy default, the handheld railgun is hidden, since it isn't very useful outside of combat.
